# ALU AirBnB Clone

## Project Description

The ALU AirBnB clone is a command-line interpreter that allows users to:

    - Create new data models (e.g., users, places, reviews)
    - Save these objects to a JSON file
    - Retrieve, update, and destroy stored objects using commands

## Command Interpreter Description

The command-line interpreter allows users to interact with instances of various
classes (such as BaseModel, User, State, etc.) and perform actions like:
Creating new instances
Displaying instances
Deleting instances
Updating instance attributes

### Features

Object creation, display, deletion, and updates.
Interaction with models such as BaseModel, User, State, City, Amenity, Place, and Review.
Command history using the readline module.

## How to Start the Interpreter

To start the interpreter, run the following command in your terminal:
bash
./console.py or python3 console.py

This will launch the interactive shell. You should see the prompt:

> (hbnb)

##How to Use the Command Interpreter

Once the interpreter is running, you can use the following commands to interact with it:

1. **Create a New Instance**:

   - Syntax: `create <class name>`
   - Example:
     create User
     This will create a new instance of the `User` class and print the instance ID.

2. **Display an Instance**:

   - Syntax: `show <class name> <id>`
   - Example:
     show User 12345
     This will display the instance of `User` with the ID `12345`.

3. **Delete an Instance**:

   - Syntax: `destroy <class name> <id>`
   - Example:
     destroy User 12345
     This will delete the instance of `User` with the ID `12345`.

4. **Display All Instances**:

   - Syntax: `all <class name>`
   - Example:
     all User
     This will display all `User` instances. If no class name is provided, it will display all instances.

5. **Update an Instance**:
   - Syntax: `update <class name> <id> <attribute name> <attribute value>`
   - Example:
     update User 12345 name "John Doe"
     ```
     This will update the name attribute of the User instance with the ID 12345 to "John Doe".
     ```
