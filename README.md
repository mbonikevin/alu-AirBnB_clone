# ALU AirBnB Clone

This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB console application. It is part of the ALU curriculum and aims to help students understand the basics of object-oriented programming, file serialization, and building a command-line interface in Python.

## üìú Project Description

The ALU AirBnB clone is a command-line interpreter that allows users to:
- Create new data models (e.g., users, places, reviews)
- Save these objects to a JSON file
- Retrieve, update, and destroy stored objects using commands

It follows the object-oriented programming paradigm and uses custom classes for each data model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Start the Command Interpreter

You must have Python 3.8.5 installed. On Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:

```bash
./console.py
